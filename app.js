/*
 * TODO: Start working up the requestor from firebase.
 * All it needs to do (for the most part) is just ask for the URL of the cloud app with the file location appended.
 * From there, I should be able to handle all of the bucket bits within here, using cloud/storage + firebase/functions.
 * even the uploading will be handled here.
 * I should probably set up a entirely new firebase app for it using my x.xirel.x account, for consistency.
 * Basic workflow: webm gets uploaded --> trigger fires from firebase-functions --> send http request to here -->
 * respond with 200, return file found check and start promise chain -->  transcode file --> end promise chain
 * may make sense to include a realtime database portion to check status of converted files, hold names, etc.
